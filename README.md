# Time Drops
Time Drops is a special individual task manager. The project is based on the premise of being able to visualize and manage one's daily activities as a fluid to be moved.

It is currently still under development, but from a technical point of view one can appreciate the implementation of a small physics engine that allows the creation of graphical objects that simulate the movement of a viscous fluid. To test its potential you can open the project in Xcode and open the PhysicsView.swift file, in the preview you will be able to try a small implementation of such an element.
